				<h2>THE ROSENWALD SCHOOLS</h2>
				<p>In 1912, a partnership struck between Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald would spur the
					construction of nearly five-thousand public school buildings for African American communities in the rural
					South.
					Washington was the president of Tuskegee Institute, and Rosenwald, the president of Sears-Roebuck. Their
					partnership
					was based on a model, proposed by Washington and approved by Rosenwald, that would award matching grants to
					rural black communities who were interested in constructing new educational facilities. For example, one of the earliest
					Rosenwald schools was the <a href="http://rosenwald.fisk.edu/index.php?module=search.details&set_v=aWQ9MzU1&school_county=macon&school_state=AL&button=Search&o=0" target="_blank">Notasulga School</a> in Macon County, Alabama, for which
					Rosenwald offered a $300 grant and the community fundraised $342.
					Funds could be raised with cash or with other contributions, like providing labor.</p>
				<p>This funding model and philosophy were based on Washington's (controversial) philosophy of "self-help," in which he felt
					the best way for black Americans to achieve racial justice was slowly, incrementally, and through individual hard work.
					In addition to black communities and Rosenwald grants, the schools were funded by public revenue and, less frequently, white allies.
					All told, the public investment represented 64% – or $17.7 million – of the total funding for the schools, making these
					buildings one of the largest public investments in black education in US American history.</p>
				<p>Known today as the Rosenwald schools, these buildings served multiple purposes, ranging from traditional
					educational facilities to community
					institutions and centers of local cultural events. In addition to traditional schools, the building program
					also
					helped to construct teachers' homes. Although the Rosenwald building program ended in 1932, the schools
					remained in popular use until desegregation in 1954. In some cases, Rosenwald structures continue to be
					utilized today,
					ranging in function from museums and community centers to repurposed schoolhouse buildings. Unfortunately,
					within
					the 15 participating Rosenwald states, it is not always clear which of the 5,357 structures are still extant –
					especially considering they were mostly built in rural areas.</p><br>
				<h2>MAP, METHODS, AND DATA</h2>
				<p>The above map represents the current state of knowledge on existing Rosenwald schools across the 15
					participating states.
					Hover the mouse over a school to learn more about its construction costs, which are based on the <a href="http://rosenwald.fisk.edu/archives" target="_blank">archives from Fisk University</a>.
					The data – aggregated into a single shapefile from a variety of sources including state historic preservation
					organizations,
					National Register of Historic Places submissions, and individual research projects – represents 603 Rosenwald
					structures. This translates to about 11.25% of the orginal schools.
					I created the dataset during an internship with the National Trust for Historic Preservation during the summer
					of 2018 using a combination of QGIS and ArcGIS Pro.</p>
				<p>Consolidating data from many different sources and organizations is one of the foremost challenges in
					producing a suitable
					map of the current Rosenwald schools. For example, while Tennessee and Texas both contained many hundreds of
					Rosenwald schools in the
					20th century, they are not well represented on the map above. Records of Rosenwald schools were not formally
					kept in Texas, and Tennessee
					is still completing a statewide survey of existing schools. Conversely, North Carolina has completed an
					exceedingly thorough survey
					of the Rosenwald schools such that this map gives the impression that NC is home to far more Rosenwald schools
					than other states
					(which is, of course, not the case in reality). For those reasons, and many others, our current knowledge of
					Rosenwald schools
					remains uneven at best.</p>
