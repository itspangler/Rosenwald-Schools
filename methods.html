<p>This map represents the current state of knowledge on existing Rosenwald schools
    across the 15
    participating states.

    The data – aggregated into a single spatial dataset from a variety of sources including state historic preservation
    organizations,
    National Register of Historic Places submissions, and individual research projects – represents 603 Rosenwald
    structures. This translates to about 11.25% of the orginal schools. The dataset contains notable gaps in some states
    where records of school locations were not carefully kept (e.g., Texas) or surveys of school locations were ongoing
    at the time of data creation (e.g., Tennessee).</p>
<p>The data follows a schema for cultural resources developed by the National Parks Service
    (NPS), the <b> Cultural Resource Spatial Data Transfer Standards</b> or <b> SDS</b>. The SDS is a data management
    schema
    that prioritizes locational data and metadata (as opposed to descriptive data) in the resource's main attribute
    table. A unique Global ID tag is assigned to each record (e.g., each Rosenwald School), allowing other descriptive
    data such as
    funding sources to be easily related or associated with other existing databases. Read more about the SDS at the <a
        href="https://www.nps.gov/hdp/standards/crgisstandards2.htm">NPS' website</a>, and learn more about the
