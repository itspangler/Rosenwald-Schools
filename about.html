<h6 class="infohead">About the Rosenwald Schools</h6>
<div class="marginbottom">
<p>In 1912, a partnership struck between Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald would spur the construction of nearly five-thousand public school buildings for African American communities in the rural South. Washington was the president of Tuskegee Institute, and Rosenwald, the president of Sears-Roebuck. Their partnership was based on a model, proposed by Washington and approved by Rosenwald, that would award matching grants to rural black communities who were interested in constructing new educational facilities.</p>

<p>This funding model and philosophy were based on Washington's (controversial) philosophy of "self-help," in which he felt the best way for black Americans to achieve racial justice was slowly, incrementally, and through individual hard work. In addition to black communities and Rosenwald grants, the schools were funded by public revenue and, less frequently, white allies. All told, the public investment represented 64% – or $17.7 million – of the total funding for the schools, making these buildings one of the largest public investments in black education in US American history.

<p>Known today as the Rosenwald schools, these buildings served multiple purposes, ranging from traditional educational facilities to community institutions and centers of local cultural events. In addition to traditional schools, the building program also helped to construct teachers' homes. Although the Rosenwald building program ended in 1932, the schools remained in popular use until desegregation in 1954. In some cases, Rosenwald structures continue to be utilized today, ranging in function from museums and community centers to repurposed schoolhouse buildings. Unfortunately, within the 15 participating Rosenwald states, it is not always clear which of the 5,357 structures are still extant – especially considering they were mostly built in rural areas.
